    <h1>Sensing</h1>
    Spot senses by using stero cameras for obstacle and people detection. Since Spot can be used in close proximity to people, it's important that safety is ensured in such environments. In the picture, Spot can sense that there is a table in front of it and should take action to avoid crashing into the table.
    <h1>Planning</h1>
    In the picture, perhaps Spot's objective is to pick up and deliver the can of soda on the table. As a result, planning takes place after the stereo cameras map out the environment (so Spot can avoid obstacles) and inverse kinematics can be applied to the arm to successfully pick up the can (once the can is located).
    <h1>Acting</h1>
    Thus, as a result, Spot acts by sending the correct torques and joint angles to the arm as well as walking and stopping a reasonable distance away from the table in order to pick up the can.
